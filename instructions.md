# SBA 308A - JavaScript Web Application  

## Introduction  

This assessment measures your capability to implement advanced JavaScript tools and features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline you have been given.

- **Duration:** two (2) days (take‑home assessment)  
- **Due:** 5:00 pm on the second day after assignment is given  
- **Instructor support:** May provide class time for work, schedule permitting  

---

## Objectives  

- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.  
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.  
- Generate asynchronous code using **Promises** and **async/await** syntax.  
- Use **fetch** and/or **Axios** to interact with an external web API.  
- Organize files using **modules** and **imports**.

## Instructions  

1. Create a small **single‑page** web application.  
2. Topic and content are entirely up to you—be creative!  
3. Follow the **technical requirements** listed below.  
4. Aim for the **minimum requirements first**, then add extra features if time permits.  

> **Tip:** Design from the user’s perspective. Good UX leads to higher trust and repeat usage.

### External API  

You’ll need an external API to satisfy several requirements. Choose one early, ensuring it supports the needed operations (GET, POST/PUT/PATCH).  

- A useful list of free APIs is provided in the assignment (link in the original PDF).  
- Recommended starters: **The Cat API** or **The Dog API** (both support required features).

## Requirements  

| Requirement | Description | Weight |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Fetch/Axios** | Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Populate your app’s content with the returned data. | **20 %** |
| **User Interaction** | Implement a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar that triggers GET requests. | **15 %** |
| ~~**Data Manipulation**~~ | ~~Allow users to send POST, PUT, or PATCH requests to the API (ensure the API supports it).~~ | ~~**15 %**~~ |
| **Async Syntax** | Use Promises and async/await where appropriate. | **15 %** |
| **Modular Code** | Split JavaScript into **at least three** module files and import/export functions/data as needed. | **3 %** |
| **Event‑Loop Correctness** | Avoid race conditions or out‑of‑order API handling; demonstrate proper event‑loop understanding. | **5 %** |
| **HTML/CSS UX** | Create an engaging UI with HTML and CSS. | **5 %** |
| **Error‑Free Execution** | Program runs without errors; comment out non‑working parts and explain blockers (partial credit possible). | **10 %** |
| **Git Commits** | Commit frequently to the local repository. | **5 %** |
| **README** | Include a README describing the application. | **2 %** |
| **Effort & Creativity** | Overall creativity, presentation, and user experience. | **5 %** |

## Reflection (Optional)

After completing the project, answer the following prompts to deepen your learning:

1. **Planning improvements:** What could you have done differently during planning to make execution easier?  
2. **Difficult requirements:** Which requirements were hardest to implement, and how could they be simplified in future projects?  
3. **Future enhancements:** If you had more time, what would you add or change in your application?  

Use this space for notes that will help you on similar tasks later.
